### Text projects: 5/17

#### [Reverse string](Text/ReverseString)
![Text - Reverse string](https://github.com/nagmagit/Martyr2-MegaProjectIdeasList-Challenge/workflows/Text%20-%20Reverse%20string/badge.svg)

Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.

#### [Pig Latin](Text/PigLatin)
![Text - Pig Latin](https://github.com/nagmagit/Martyr2-MegaProjectIdeasList-Challenge/workflows/Text%20-%20Pig%20Latin/badge.svg)

Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an "ay" is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield "anana-bay"). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.

#### [Count Vowels](Text/CountVowels)
![Text - Count vowels](https://github.com/nagmagit/Martyr2-MegaProjectIdeasList-Challenge/workflows/Text%20-%20Count%20vowels/badge.svg)

Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.

#### [Check if palindrome](Text/CheckIfPalindrome)
![Text - Check if palindrome](https://github.com/nagmagit/Martyr2-MegaProjectIdeasList-Challenge/workflows/Text%20-%20Check%20if%20palindrome/badge.svg)

Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”

#### [Count words in a string](Text/CountWordsInAString)
![Text - Count words in a string](https://github.com/nagmagit/Martyr2-MegaProjectIdeasList-Challenge/workflows/Text%20-%20Count%20words%20in%20a%20string/badge.svg)
